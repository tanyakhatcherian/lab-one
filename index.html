            <p class="box-one"><strong class="highlight">Hello!</strong> My name is Tanya Khatcherian. I was born in Canada and my nationality is Armenian.
                I just switched into Interaction Design at George Brown. Prior to this program, I finished my BA degree in Law at Carleton University. 
                Currently, my favourite things to do are play <em>Animal Crossing New Horizons</em> and skateboard. If we weren't quarantining, my favourite thing to
                do would be hanging out with my friends. This is my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tanyewestttt/" target="_blank">instagram</a> account. 
            </p>

        <h2 class = "underline secondary-heading center-this">Why I'm Here</h2>
        <p>I chose Interaction Design because I've always had a creative side. I enjoy art and architecture but I prefer things on a digital
            scale. The process of app creation and app programming really intrigued me. I like the UI aspects of creating websites and applications a lot
            but I am interested in learning all tasks involved in app creation. I also love animation but I lack the ability to draw well enough! Maybe one day,
            with a lot of practice. I have dabbled in one Java course at Carleton but it was a nightmare. I'm hoping HTML & CSS are kinder to me.
        </p>
